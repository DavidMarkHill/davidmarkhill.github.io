## Hello World!

To say that technology has progressed in recent years is something short of an understatement.
In today's day and age, it's truly a feat to keep up-to-date with this so called "perfect storm".
I'm hoping this blog will help me organise my thoughts and force me to learn the intricacies I 
may happen to avoid had I not written about the subject.

Thank you for visiting! I look forward to sharing my insight in a field we all feel so passionate about.
