## Getting started

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) can automatically generate and serve the website for you.
Let's say you have a username/organisation `my-org` and project `my-proj`; if you locate Jekyll source under `blog` folder of master branch in your repo `github.com/my-org/my-proj`, the website will be served on `my-org.github.io/my-proj`.

1. Just download or fork and clone the source from [github.com/janczizikow/sleek](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek/).
2. Make sure your local machine has ruby and node
2. Edit site settings in  `_config.yml` file according to your project.
3. Replace `favicons` and `_includes/logo.svg` with your own logo.

**Note** that you might have to adjust some CSS depending on the width and height of your logo. You can find Header / Navigation related SCSS in `_sass/layout/nav.scss`.
